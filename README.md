# Music Player Project Instructions

## 1. Find an Image of a Music Player

- Search for an image of a music player that you'd like to recreate.
- Be creative! It doesn't have to be exactly like Spotify, feel free to explore different designs.
- Save the image to your computer.

## 2. Create a Link on Your Main HTML Page

- Open your `index.html` using a Live Server.
- Create a link on your `index.html` that redirects to another HTML page.
- This new HTML page will showcase the image of the music player that you're recreating, while the `index.html` is your own work.

## 3. Pick Three Songs and Obtain Audio Files

- Choose three songs (or any audio, it could be podcasts, for example) that you'd like to showcase in your music player.
- You can find free-to-use audio files online or use online converters to extract audio from YouTube videos.
- We can also hack Bandcamp together, just ask.
- Add your songs information to the track list in your code. You'll have to analyze it to find where this should be inputted.

## 4. Style Your Music Player

- Part of this challenge is to not change any of the class names; you do not need to delete anything to get it working, only add to it.
- Use CSS to style the elements and get your music player as close to your inspiration as possible.
- Pay attention to details like colors, fonts, buttons, and layout to match your chosen design.
